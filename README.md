## Purpose
The purpose of the study is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a 
classification system for the new investment. To make the report I used unsupervised machine learning module because there is no known output.
I used four technical analysis to complete the project:
- Preprocessed the Data for PCA
- Reduced the Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustered Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualized Cryptocurrencies Results
